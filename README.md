## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v14 or higher) - Required for the real-time server
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone or download** the project to your local machine
2. **Navigate to the project directory**
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Real-Time Application

#### Start the Server
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd ChatApplication

# Start the real-time server
node realtime-server.js
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8000`

#### Access the Application
1. Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:8000/realtime-chat.html`
2. Or use the demo script:
   ```bash
   ./demo.sh
   ```
3. Or use the multi-user test page: `http://localhost:8000/test-multiuser.html`

#### Testing Multi-User Functionality
1. Open the multi-user test page: `http://localhost:8000/test-multiuser.html`
2. Click the buttons to open multiple chat windows
3. Use different usernames in each window (e.g., "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie")
4. Test real-time messaging between users
5. Try room switching, creation, and deletion
6. Observe real-time user list updates

### Legacy Static Version
For the original static version (single-user simulation), simply open `index.html` in a browser.
start index.html       # Windows
xdg-open index.html    # Linux
```

#### Method 2: Local Web Server (Recommended)
```bash
# Using Python (if installed)
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (if installed)
npx http-server

# Using PHP (if installed)
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

const MAX_USERNAME_LENGTH = 20;
const MAX_ROOM_NAME_LENGTH = 30;

// Default rooms
const DEFAULT_ROOMS = [
    { id: 'general', name: 'General' },
